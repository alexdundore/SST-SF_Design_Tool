The SAP2000 file (ending in .sdb) was created in SAP2000 v22.  
It can be used in any subsequent version as well. If a newer version of SAP2000 is to be used,
ensure that the API reference in the Excel Spreadsheet is also changed.
This can be done by opening up VBA within the document, then going to
Tools > References.  Uncheck the missing SAP2000 API reference and check the reference
for the updated SAP2000 version you are using, then try using the spreadsheet.
